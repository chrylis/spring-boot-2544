# Spring Boot #2544 demo

This is a demonstration of the requested functionality in
link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2544[#2544]. As per usual Boot habit,
I expect that registering my own `AuthenticationProvider` would keep the Boot-configured
`ProviderManager` and further Spring Security setup intact but would suppress the
`DaoAuthenticationProvider` bean provided. (For example, providing a `DataSource` suppresses
Boot's attempts to configure a JDBC connection but still wires it up to repositories.)

Instead, component-scanning registers the `MatchesAuthenticationProvider`, but Boot ignores it
completely and creates the UUID-password `DaoAuthenticationProvider`.

## Usage

Launch the application and load link:http://localhost:8080/[] in a browser. The Basic authentication
dialog will appear. I expect that the `MatchesAuthenticationProvider` will be used, so that
any matching username and password will work, but instead Boot still creates the `user`/UUID
provider.
